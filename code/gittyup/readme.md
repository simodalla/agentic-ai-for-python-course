# Gitty Up

This is an application which will work as a CLI tool for developers.

## The problem

When working on multiple computers or with many team numbers, and across many 
projects, it's easy to start working on an existing one and forget to do a 
`git pull`. Then when it's time to commit the changes, you realize you have
merge conflicts and more. This is not fun.

## The solution

This applicaticon will be run in a folder at the root of source code. It will 
traverse the current dir and all subdirs. Whenever it discovers a git repo, it 
will run the shell command `git pull --all`. This will ensure that every project 
in this directory tree is up to date and ready to roll.
